# Homework_Module11_Time_Series
In this Homework, we analyse growth  of Mercado Libre (http://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations). With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. 

We will produce a Google colab notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. We use text and comments to document findings. The main objective is to answer the question prompts in the instructions and be able to do the following:

- Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

- An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

- A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

- Answers to the questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter notebook.

- (Optional) A plot of a forecast for the companyâ€™s future revenue.

The Steps Taken:

### Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

### Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

### Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns

### Step 4: Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet

### Step 5 (Optional): Forecast the Revenue by Using Time Series Models
